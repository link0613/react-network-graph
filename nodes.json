        "description": "QATAR CHARITY (QCUK) was established ostensibly because of a need to supervise growing QC projects in the UK & Europe\n\n◆ From its inception, QCUK has had strong ties to the UK and European MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD and most of the known QCUK expenditures are being directed to MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD related projects in the UK and Europe\n\n◆ Both European QCUK trustees, AYYOUB ABOULIAQIN and HAFEZ AHMAD AHMAD (aka HAFIZ KARMI), are important leaders in UK and European MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD organizations, with an apparent attempt made to obscure the true identity of AHMAD.\n\n◆ The Sheffield, UK mosque complex being constructed by the EMAAN TRUST with the support of QCUK is the latest in a series of attempts by the EUROPE TRUST to covertly build large Islamic facilities in European cities controlled by the MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.\n\n◆ THe EMAAN TRUST Sheffield project appears to be focused on providing facilities for the Yemeni MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD in the UK and centers on UK converts to Islam.\n\n◆ Most of the EMAAN TRUST officers have problematic ties to the UK and/or global MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, Islamism, and/or extremism and terrorism."
